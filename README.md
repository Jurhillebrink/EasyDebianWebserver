# SimpleDebianWebserver
A simple Debian bashscript to create a basic webserver from a clean install

This is a work in progress (now at version 0.72). Don't use it before version 1.0 (will be finished around may 2016).


I have to install and configure webservers far to often, but everytime it's the same steps over and over again and that is... boring :(. I didn't know how to use bash so creating a script that would save me a lot of time in the long run seemed like a good enough reason to start learning it. If you have any questions, suggestions or comments, let me know!

Please note that this script is made for my specific use case and that it probably won't  be the ideal script for everyone. That being said, I think this script will work for a majority of the basic Debian users like me. If it doesn't, feel free to modify the script if you like it.
